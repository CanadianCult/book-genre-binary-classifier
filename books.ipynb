right now, I’m all alone, in a place no one else resides.\\nEven if I’d been able to touch that scenery I’d realized,\\nAll alone, I couldn’t even use my voice.\\nI give a kiss to the phantoms I loved, and in the twilit sky,\\nThe evening stars still won’t light; even my impatience seems faint — where is the moon?\\nTorn asunder, I learn of pain.\\nAmongst repetitive days, I was searching all along\\nFor a wish that could keep me walking onward.\\nI bid farewell to the phantoms I’ve met; my longings are amid the sky.\\nDays washed away by the flow of time are in the palm of my hand… like a single flower petal.\\nAs the pain persists, I face new encounters.\\nAs new encounters persist, I learn of my wish.\\nI came here, a bit of a distance away,\\nOn the inviting breeze of 02:00 AM\\nEven the city lights I dislike\\nBlurred crimson and pale\\nThe words you said that day\\nAre still my heart; yes, they are a refrain\\nIt’s a cycle of sleepless nights as I repeat them, over and over\\nWhen I think of you, anxiety is the only thing that remains\\nI am still here\\nUnable to say that I want to be by your side, unable to sleep,\\nThe more I think of you, why does it make me want to run away?\\nIf you saw me like this you’d laugh, right?\\nI’m sure you would…\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nI miss you, really.\\nI came here, a bit of a distance away,\\nOn the inviting breeze of 02:00 AM\\nThe kind, pouring rain\\nWarmly, sweetly enveloped me\\nThese kinds of feelings on nights we’re not together\\nAre dampened; yes, let it rain\\nIt’s a cycle of sleepless nights and I can’t even open an umbrella\\nWhen I think of you, anxiety is the only thing that remains\\nI am still hoping\\nUnable to talk about these kind of nights, unable to sleep,\\nWhy has the act of thinking of you become sad?\\nTomorrow, we’ll see each other as we always do, won’t we?\\nI’m sure we will…\\nWhen I think of you, anxiety is the only thing that remains\\nI am still here\\nUnable to say that I want to be by your side, at 02:00 AM\\nThe more I think of you, why does it make me want to run away?\\nIf you saw me like this you’d laugh, right?\\nI’m sure you would…\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nI miss you, really.\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nYou don’t know how I really I feel.\\nI miss you, really.\\nHeadlights stream out vividly,\\nMy feelings sayin’, “I don’t wanna go home just yet”.\\nTail lamps grow distant in a sad little way,\\nDancing a capricious, clumsy dance.\\nI dash down the slope, just like a midnight ballerina;\\nA floating step, in the moonlight.\\nA flowing step – a rising face in profile,\\nWhat I wanted to tell you was something pure and ever so slight –\\nMy heartbeat is accelerating just a bit… though I’m sure you’d laugh that I’m still not over it.\\nI’m dreamily having an unending dream…\\nListening to a voice that won’t fade…\\nI try to break an unbreaking night –\\nWho can tell why I miss you, really?\\nHeadlights hastily flow away –\\nTonight’s gonna be another Sleepless Night!\\nTail lamps grow distant in a sad little way,\\nAnd only the unclosing distance between us…\\n… it’s an unending loop.
